# numbergame-java
📚 **Overview**
- In this game, the player sets a limit for the range of numbers. The system then generates a random number within that range, and the player has a fixed number of chances to guess it correctly. Points are awarded based on the number of attempts taken, and hints are provided to guide the player after each wrong guess.

🚀 **Key Features**
- **Customizable Range**: Players can choose the upper limit for the number to be guessed.

- **Limited Attempts**: Players get a fixed number of chances to guess the correct number.

- **Hint System**: After each incorrect guess, a hint is provided indicating whether the guessed number is too high or too low.

- **Points System**: Players start with a fixed score, and points are deducted with each incorrect guess.

- **Winning and Losing Conditions**: The game announces whether the player has won or lost based on their guesses.

🎯 **Objective**
- The goal is to guess the randomly generated number within the given chances. The fewer the attempts, the higher the final score.

📝 **How to Play**
- **Set the Limit**: Enter the maximum number to define the range for the random number.

- **Start Guessing**: Try to guess the correct number.

- **Receive Hints**: After each wrong guess, a hint is provided to help narrow down the options.

- **Win or Lose**: Guess correctly to win with the remaining points, or exhaust all chances and lose.

🎁 **Game Outcome**
- Win: Guess the correct number and retain the remaining points.

- Lose: Exhaust all chances without guessing the correct number.
